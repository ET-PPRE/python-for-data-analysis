<h4 id="task">🎯 Task</h4>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to work with a simulated dataset containing solar and wind power generation data, and to perform the primary inspection before cleaning and processing, visualizing and analyzing it.</p> 

<p>Import the dataset <strong>power_generation_data.csv</p>strong> into a Pandas DataFrame called <code>power_data</code>. This file is avaialble to you in this directory, there is no need to state the file path while you import, <strong>only the file name</strong>.Check the first 5 rows of the dataset to get an overview of the data, save these rows into a variable called <code>data_inspection</code>.</p> 

<p>Perform basic inspection to understand the data types and structure. Check for missing values in the dataset, save the sum of the missing values into a variable called <code>missing_values</code>.</p>

<p>It is common that there is missing values within the dataset, therefore handling missing value is a typical task of data processing. Handle the missing values you detected by filling them using forward filling. Save the dataframe with the filled missing values into a new DataFrame called <code>clean_data</code>.</p>

<h4 id="restrictions">🔒 Restrictions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use only pandas</strong></li>
<li>Follow the exact naming (<code>power_data</code>, <code>data_inspection</code>, <code>missing_values</code>, <code>clean_data</code>).</li>
</ul>
