#### 🎯 Task

Read the data in the **measurements_2009.csv** file, available to you in this directory (no need to state a path only the file name). Extracted wind speed data at 100m from the **WS-100** column of this file and save them in a variable called `ws100`. Plot the wind speed time series using matplotlib's `.plot()` function.

You should use the **object oriented** way of plotting, make sure to initialize you plot as:

```fig, ax = plt.subplots()
```

#### 🔒 Restrictions

* **Use only pandas and matplotlib** 
* Use Object-Oriented plotting
* Follow the exact naming (`ws100`).
