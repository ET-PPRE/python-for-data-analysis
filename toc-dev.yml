# TOC File Structure Guidelines for Learning Platform
#
# Each top-level entry under "chapters" is a course chapter.
# Each chapter must include:
#     - slug: unique identifier (used for URL routing or database lookup)
#     - title: human-readable title of the chapter
#     - order: integer for display ordering (starts from 1, no gaps)
# Each chapter can contain a list of "assignments":
#     - Each assignment must also have:
#         - slug: unique per assignment (use lowercase + underscores)
#         - title: display name of the assignment
#         - order: integer for ordering within that chapter
#         - book: location of file inside book folder including filename without extension/file-type
#         - points: number of points the assignment carries
#         - difficulty: one of: "Easy", "Intermediate", "Hard"
#         - publist_at: ISO 8601 string when this assignment becomes visible (e.g. "2025-10-15T08:00:00")
#
# Do NOT skip order numbers (e.g. use 1,2,3... not 1,3,5)
# Order numbers are per-level (chapter vs assignment)
# Keep slugs consistent with filenames or database entries
# Avoid special characters or spaces in slugs (use snake_case)
# Titles can contain spaces and capitalization (for UI display)
#
