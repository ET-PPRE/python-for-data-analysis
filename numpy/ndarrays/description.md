#### 🎯 Task

Write a Python function `array_operations()` that performs the following tasks:

- Creates a NumPy array of integers from 1 to 10.
- Calculates the **sum** and the **mean** of the array elements.
- Assigns the calculated sum to a variable named `arr_sum` and the mean to a variable named `arr_mean`.
- Prints the original array, the sum, and the mean.

#### 🔒 Restrictions

* **Use only numpy** 
* Follow the exact naming (`array_operations()`, `arr_sum`, `arr_mean`).
