#### 🎯 Task

Write a Python code that calculates the area of a circle and a sphere with a set radius of $r = 500$cm, where: 

$\text{Area of Circle} = \pi \cdot r^2$<br>
$\text{Area of Sphere} = 4\pi \cdot r^2$

The results should be assigned to variables called `a_circle` and `a_sphere` in $m^2$. Print the result using f-string.

#### 🔒 Restrictions

* **Do not use any external libraries**.
* Use basic Python operations to check whether a number is even or odd.
* Follow the exact naming (`a_circle`, `a_sphere`).
