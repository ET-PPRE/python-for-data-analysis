<h4 id="task">🎯 Task</h4>

<p>You are given the daily energy output (in kWh) of three different solar panels over a week and have to calculate the energy that 
has been generated during this time. </p>

<ul>
<li>Create a dictionary called <code>panel_output</code>, where each <strong>key</strong> is called <code>Panel1</code>, <code>Panel2</code>, <code>Panel3</code>,
which have generated the following energy for the week we are analyzing:
    <br> <strong>Panel1</strong>: [23, 25, 28, 21, 26, 27, 25] </br>
    <br> <strong>Panel2</strong>: [24, -9999, 27, 26, -88888, 29, 26]</br>
    <br> <strong>Panel3</strong>: [20, 22, 23, 21, 24, 25, 22]</br>
</li>
<li>The values -9999 and -88888 in <code>Panel2</code> indicate erroneous readings. Before performing any calculation you should replace all values less than zero in <code>Panel2</code> with <code>0</code>, save the modified dictionary as a new variable called <code>panel_output_cleaned</code>.
</li>

<li>Write a function called <code>weekly_production</code>, that takes the <strong>list</strong> of the seven daily measurements of the solar panels and <strong>returns</strong> the total output over the week. Create a loop to use your function to print each panel’s label and its total weekly output.</li>
<li>Determine the panel with the highest total output and save its label as <code>most_produced</code>, print the name of the panel and the total value.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="restrictions">🔒 Restrictions</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use any external libraries</strong>.</li>
<li>Follow the exact naming (<code>panel_output</code>,
<code>Panel1</code>, <code>Panel2</code>, <code>Panel3</code>, <code>panel_output_cleaned</code>, <code>weekly_production</code>, <code>most_produced</code>).</li>
</ul>
