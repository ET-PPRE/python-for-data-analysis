#### 🎯 Task

You have to store and analyze student grades in a class, to do so follow the steps below:

- Create a dictionary called `student_grades`, where the **keys** are student names (as strings) and the **values** are lists of integers representing their scores in three exams.
- Write a function called, `avg_grade`, that takes a list of scores and returns the average grade.
- Use a `for` loop to call this function for every student and print each student’s name along with their average grade.
- Find the student with the highest average and save their name in a variable called `top_student` and print this value.

#### 🔒 Restrictions

* **Do not use any external libraries**.
* Follow the exact naming (`student_grades`, `avg_grade`, `top_student`).
