#### 🎯 Task

A vector in three dimensions has three components *x, y, z*. It is up to you how to realize such a data structure,  `tuples` or `lists` can be used.

 - Create a list called `vectors` that contains 5 vectors, filled with random integers of your choosing.
 - Write a function called `vmag` that calculates the magnitude $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ for a single vector. Apply the function to each of the vectors, and print the vector along with the magnitude.
 - Find the vectors with the smallest and the largest magnitude, save them in `min_vector` and `max_vector` variables and print them.

#### 🔒 Restrictions

* **Do not use any external libraries**.
* Follow the exact naming (`vectors`, `vmag`, `min_vector`, `max_vector`).
