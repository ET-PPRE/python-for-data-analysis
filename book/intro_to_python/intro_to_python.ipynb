An introduction to Python was provided in the documentation of the website, the learning material starts with essential concepts such as data types, variables, input and output operations. Key points presented here aim to help learners understand how to store and manipulate data, interact with users, and annotate their code for readability. By the end of this chapter, you will be familiar with the basic building blocks required for writing effective Python scripts."

Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation._\n",
