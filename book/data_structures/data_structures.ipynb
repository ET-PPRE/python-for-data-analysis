    "In many situation you wish to store and handle several objects in a common container - think of a list, or an array in other programming languages. There are several options for doing so in python, with different properties and purposes. In the following we will get to know some of the 'native' Python data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequences\n",
    "A **sequence** is a specific type of data structure that is **ordered** and supports **indexing**. The key characteristics of sequences include:\n",
    "- **Ordered**: The elements have a defined order.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: You can access elements by their index (position in the sequence).\n",
    "- **Slicing**: Sequences support slicing to retrieve subsets of elements.\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Sequences can be iterated through, element by element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in sequences. They either store _references_ to the data, i.e. the pointer-like variables as above, in which case they are called _container sequences_, or they instead hold the _data_ itself and are called _flat sequences_ :\n",
    "- **container sequences**, they can hold _references_ to objects of different types:\n",
    "  - _list_, _tuple_, _deque_\n",
    "- **flat sequences**, they hold _objects_ of one type:\n",
    "  - _str_, _bytes_, _bytearray_, _memoryview_, _array_\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of classifying the above sequences is their _mutability_ :\n",
    "- **Mutable sequences**, whose elements can be modified:\n",
    "  - _list_, _bytearray_, _array_, _deque_, _memoryview_\n",
    "- **Immutable sequences**, whose elements cannot be changed:\n",
    "  - _tuple_, _str_, _bytes_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Sequence Data Structures:\n",
    "Some Python data structures, like **dictionaries** and **sets**, are not considered sequences because:\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: They are unordered, and they are accessed by keys, not by index.\n",
    "- **Sets**: They are unordered collections of unique elements, so indexing and slicing are not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not go through all the data structures in detail here, just a selection. "
